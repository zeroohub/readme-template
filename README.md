# My Awesome Project

*(approx. few sentences)*

Put some short, clean description at this place. Describe what it can do and what not, when it should be used in one or two sentences. If you are writing a functional module, its name must clearly describe the function of this module.

All sections below are optional. You can delete some sections if it's too much for you, but better follow the order. Order of sections are not at random, for more reference to [Cognitive funneling](https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme#cognitive-funneling).

### Table of contents

## Features

*(approx. few paragraph)*

Little more details. Describe highlights features in **split paragraph**, what makes your project different from others. 

## Quick Start

### Install

Detail install instructions in **ordered list**, If it's different according to platform, describe them in separate paragraphs. 

Put the most common case at top, reference common install errors in *FAQ* sections.

### Common Usage

Give a common usage example of your projects, layout input and output, give all information on how to start use your project quickly. 

This also means you don't try to put all the details in this part, only options which most of people will use.

Example in this section should be included in your project, so people can clone your project and test it in no time.
